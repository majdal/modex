Use Cases and Stories
=====================


Case: policy makers in a room together with some iPads out, an old Windows XP laptop, and a programmer-researcher presenting them a model to play with.


Case: researchers in the world at large, collaborating, github-like.
 implications: sessioning, flexibility, forking of models, comments, and reasonable permalinks.


Case: a running model-explorer instance that can be linked from a news article and invite

Bib has written some models in NetLogo. He is slowly learning programming concepts like loops, lists and subroutines, but is not totally comfortable yet.
Still, he is trying because he has a strong background in group-dynamics sociology, and feels a strong need to bring computational power to his problems.
He has had advice from a couple people that he should look into Repast, and he's had the odd advice for VB and SciPy.
He knows he wants to have agents, and he knows he wants them to be interacting on GIS data, but he has no idea how to do this.

Alice is a skilled Java programmer and is interested in _helping the world_. She thinks that she could make an impact by getting into computational social science, but she doesn't know where to start. She has never done visualization work in her life.

Terry has a model which generates terabytes of plain text output per second. Currently, he is analysing this output with a mixture of shell scripts which animate it using igraph and matplotlib and by dumping it into R, which sometimes crashes and always needs to be babied.
