This is a project building off of [sig.uwaterloo.ca's](Social Innovation Group) work at the Univeristy of Waterloo.

Our perspective is holistic: we see agriculture as simultaneously economic, ecological, cultural and as involving both urban humans, rural humans, and animal life.

When we want to get off github, know that this wiki itself is simply a git repo with URL https://github.com/majdal/modex.wiki.git and the issue tracker can be extracted with the REST API ([this ruby project](http://github.com/sorich87/github-to-bitbucket-issues-migration) is a one-click export solution).
